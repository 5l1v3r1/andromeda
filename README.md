What is Andromeda ? 
===================
In order to ease the use of Frida during app analysis/assessment and to keep things organized, Andromeda was built. Andromeda is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) based on Frida and powered by Python under the hood. 
Andromeda helps researcher/pentester during dynamic app analysis with features like classes and methods enumeration, hooking and intercepting particular methods with ease of clicks.  It also creates javascript snippets, on the run, which further helps in hooking and interception.
For those who prefer typical CLI based approach, one of the Andromeda’s feature allows to fulfill this need. It takes care of Javascript snippets and allows researcher to interact with CLI at the same time. (See next section for more details)

Features:
=========
